## :rocket: Tecnologies

This project was developed with the following tecnologies:

## ðŸ’» Project

This app is still being developed and commented by me but you are free to make any PR's that can improve my code.

Ecoleta is a project that connects people who have recycled trash pickup points with people that have recycle trash to dispose safely. I was made during the 1Âº Next Level Week presented by Rocketseat. 

At the first edition of the Next Level Week we developed an web/mobile app that has advanced concepts of React and Nodejs. We saw a lot about routes and implemented a Sqlite database using Knex on the back-end and this was the first project that rocketseat presented us that uses Typescript along with React. It's a very powerfull tool and makes it less problematic to escalate the app.
